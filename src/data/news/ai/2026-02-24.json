    "content": "arXiv:2602.18494v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: A dominant paradigm in visual intelligence treats semantics as a static property of latent representations, assuming that meaning can be discovered through geometric proximity in high dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we argue that this view is physically incomplete. We propose that intelligence is not a passive mirror of reality but a property of a physically realizable agent, a system bounded by finite memory, finite compute, and finite energy interacting with a high entropy environment. We formalize this interaction through the kinematic structure of an Observation Semantics Fiber Bundle, where raw sensory observation data (the fiber) is projected onto a low entropy causal semantic manifold (the base). We prove that for any bounded agent, the thermodynamic cost of information processing (Landauer's Principle) imposes a strict limit on the complexity of internal state transitions. We term this limit the Semantic Constant B. From these physical constraints, we derive the necessity of symbolic structure. We show that to model a combinatorial world within the bound B, the semantic manifold must undergo a phase transition, it must crystallize into a discrete, compositional, and factorized form. Thus, language and logic are not cultural artifacts but ontological necessities the solid state of information required to prevent thermal collapse. We conclude that understanding is not the recovery of a hidden latent variable, but the construction of a causal quotient that renders the world algorithmically compressible and causally predictable.",

    "content": "arXiv:2602.18582v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: When training artificial intelligence (AI) to perform tasks, humans often care not only about whether a task is completed but also how it is performed. As AI agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, aligning their behavior with human-provided specifications becomes critical for responsible AI deployment. Reward design provides a direct channel for such alignment by translating human expectations into reward functions that guide reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing methods are often too limited to capture nuanced human preferences that arise in long-horizon tasks. Hence, we introduce Hierarchical Reward Design from Language (HRDL): a problem formulation that extends classical reward design to encode richer behavioral specifications for hierarchical RL agents. We further propose Language to Hierarchical Rewards (L2HR) as a solution to HRDL. Experiments show that AI agents trained with rewards designed via L2HR not only complete tasks effectively but also better adhere to human specifications. Together, HRDL and L2HR advance the research on human-aligned AI agents.",

    "content": "arXiv:2602.18607v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In CAS adaptation, a challenge is to define the dynamic architecture of the system and changes in its behavior. Implementation-wise, this is projected into an adaptation mechanism, typically realized as an Adaptation Manager (AM). With the advances of generative LLMs, generating AM code based on system specification and desired AM behavior (partially in natural language) is a tempting opportunity. The recent introduction of vibe coding suggests a way to target the problem of the correctness of generated code by iterative testing and vibe coding feedback loops instead of direct code inspection.\n  In this paper, we show that generating an AM via vibe coding feedback loops is a viable option when the verification of the generated AM is based on a very precise formulation of the functional requirements. We specify these as constraints in a novel temporal logic FCL that allows us to express the behavior of traces with much finer granularity than classical LTL enables.\n  Furthermore, we show that by combining the adaptation and vibe coding feedback loops where the FCL constraints are evaluated for the current system state, we achieved good results in the experiments with generating AMs for two example systems from the CAS domain. Typically, just a few feedback loop iterations were necessary, each feeding the LLM with reports describing detailed violations of the constraints. This AM testing was combined with high run path coverage achieved by different initial settings.",

Progress in this domain is increasingly bottlenecked by the engineering context constraint: the arduous process of translating ambiguous product intent into reasonable, executable, verifiable hypotheses, rather than by modeling techniques alone. We present GEARS (Generative Engine for Agentic Ranking Systems), a framework that reframes ranking optimization as an autonomous discovery process within a programmable experimentation environment. Rather than treating optimization as static model selection, GEARS leverages Specialized Agent Skills to encapsulate ranking expert knowledge into reusable reasoning capabilities, enabling operators to steer systems via high-level intent vibe personalization. Furthermore, to ensure production reliability, the framework incorporates validation hooks to enforce statistical robustness and filter out brittle policies that overfit short-term signals. Experimental validation across diverse product surfaces demonstrates that GEARS consistently identifies superior, near-Pareto-efficient policies by synergizing algorithmic signals with deep ranking context while maintaining rigorous deployment stability.",

This principled approach allows us to track \"energy spills\" during decoding, which we empirically show correlate with factual errors, biases, and failures. Similar to Orgad et al. (2025), our method localizes the exact answer token and subsequently tests for hallucinations. Crucially, however, we achieve this without requiring trained probe classifiers or activation ablations. Instead, we introduce two completely training-free metrics derived directly from output logits: spilled energy, which captures the discrepancy between energy values across consecutive generation steps that should theoretically match, and marginalized energy, which is measurable at a single step. Evaluated on nine benchmarks across state-of-the-art LLMs (including LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma) and on synthetic algebraic operations (Qwen3), our approach demonstrates robust, competitive hallucination detection and cross-task generalization. Notably, these results hold for both pretrained and instruction-tuned variants without introducing any training overhead.",

    "content": "arXiv:2602.18710v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The conclusions of empirical research depend not only on data but on a sequence of analytic decisions that published results seldom make explicit. Past ``many-analyst\" studies have demonstrated this: independent teams testing the same hypothesis on the same dataset regularly reach conflicting conclusions. But such studies require months of coordination among dozens of research groups and are therefore rarely conducted. In this work, we show that fully autonomous AI analysts built on large language models (LLMs) can reproduce a similar structured analytic diversity cheaply and at scale. We task these AI analysts with testing a pre-specified hypothesis on a fixed dataset, varying the underlying model and prompt framing across replicate runs. Each AI analyst independently constructs and executes a full analysis pipeline; an AI auditor then screens each run for methodological validity. Across three datasets spanning experimental and observational designs, AI analyst-produced analyses display wide dispersion in effect sizes, $p$-values, and binary decisions on supporting the hypothesis or not, frequently reversing whether a hypothesis is judged supported. This dispersion is structured: recognizable analytic choices in preprocessing, model specification, and inference differ systematically across LLM and persona conditions. Critically, the effects are \\emph{steerable}: reassigning the analyst persona or LLM shifts the distribution of outcomes even after excluding methodologically deficient runs.",

    "content": "arXiv:2602.18724v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Accelerating exploration in visual reinforcement learning under sparse rewards remains challenging due to the substantial task-irrelevant variations. Despite advances in intrinsic exploration, many methods either assume access to low-dimensional states or lack task-aware exploration strategies, thereby rendering them fragile in visual domains. To bridge this gap, we present TEB, a Task-aware Exploration approach that tightly couples task-relevant representations with exploration through a predictive Bisimulation metric. Specifically, TEB leverages the metric not only to learn behaviorally grounded task representations but also to measure behaviorally intrinsic novelty over the learned latent space. To realize this, we first theoretically mitigate the representation collapse of degenerate bisimulation metrics under sparse rewards by internally introducing a simple but effective predicted reward differential. Building on this robust metric, we design potential-based exploration bonuses, which measure the relative novelty of adjacent observations over the latent space. Extensive experiments on MetaWorld and Maze2D show that TEB achieves superior exploration ability and outperforms recent baselines.",

Furthermore, to overcome the lack of suitable benchmarks, we introduce ChartSummInsights, a new dataset featuring a diverse collection of real-world charts paired with high-quality, insightful summaries authored by human data analysis experts.

Nevertheless, existing data allocation methods fail to address an under-explored challenge in collaboration: bidirectional model learnability gap, where client-side SLMs cannot identify high-reward samples matching their learnability constraints for effective knowledge transfer from LLMs, while LLMs struggle to select samples contributing novel knowledge beyond their existing data. Furthermore, these collaboration frameworks face another key challenge: domain-agnostic reasoning transfer, where existing reasoning transfer methods fail to flexibly adapt to the local domain data, preventing SLMs from effectively acquiring step-by-step reasoning abilities within from general LLM. To address these challenges, we propose LaDa, a federated reasoning distillation framework with model learnability-aware data allocation. It introduces a model learnability-aware data filter that adaptively allocates high-reward samples based on the learnability gap between each SLM and LLM pair, effectively facilitating bidirectional knowledge transfer. We further design a domain adaptive reasoning distillation method that aligns joint probabilities of reasoning paths on filtered high-reward samples through contrastive distillation learning between SLM and LLM, enabling SLM to capture underlying reasoning patterns under local data distribution. LaDa operates as a plug-in module for existing collaboration frameworks, adapting knowledge transfer based on model learnability gaps.",

SGD, designed for dialogue-based API discovery (2019), and MCP, now the de facto standard for LLM-tool integration, share the same core insight -- that schemas can encode not just tool signatures but operational constraints and reasoning guidance. By analyzing this convergence, we extract five foundational principles for schema design: (1) Semantic Completeness over Syntactic Precision, (2) Explicit Action Boundaries, (3) Failure Mode Documentation, (4) Progressive Disclosure Compatibility, and (5) Inter-Tool Relationship Declaration. These principles reveal three novel insights: first, SGD's original design was fundamentally sound and should be inherited by MCP; second, both frameworks leave failure modes and inter-tool relationships unexploited -- gaps we identify and resolve; third, progressive disclosure emerges as a critical production-scaling insight under real-world token constraints. We provide concrete design patterns for each principle. These principles position schema-driven governance as a scalable mechanism for AI system oversight without requiring proprietary system inspection -- central to Software 3.0.",

In this work, we propose LAMMI-Pathology (LVLM-Agent System for Molecularly Informed Medical Intelligence in Pathology), a scalable agent framework for domain-specific agent tool-calling. LAMMI-Pathology adopts a tool-centric, bottom-up architecture in which customized domain-adaptive tools serve as the foundation. These tools are clustered by domain style to form component agents, which are then coordinated through a top-level planner hierarchically, avoiding excessively long context lengths that could induce task drift. Based on that, we introduce a novel trajectory construction mechanism based on Atomic Execution Nodes (AENs), which serve as reliable and composable units for building semi-simulated reasoning trajectories that capture credible agent-tool interactions. Building on this foundation, we develop a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy that aligns the planner's decision-making process with these multi-step reasoning trajectories, thereby enhancing inference robustness in pathology understanding and its adaptive use of the customized toolset.",
