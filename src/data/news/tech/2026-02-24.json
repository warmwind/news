    "content": "Samsung is set to introduce its new Galaxy S26 lineup at its next Unpacked event on February 25th, potentially alongside a new pair of earbuds and other wearables. If you’re thinking about picking up any of the new devices, it’s worth claiming Samsung’s $30 promotional credit before it expires, which you can do by registering your interest on Samsung’s website before 1PM ET / 10AM PT tomorrow.\nIf you’re even remotely considering an upgrade, there’s not much to lose by signing up.  You don’t need to pay anything or even offer your credit card details to take advantage of the offer. You just need to reserve a device by signing up with your name and email address on Samsung’s website or the Shop Samsung app ahead of the event. Once the devices are officially announced and preorders open, you’ll be able to apply the $30 credit at checkout. Sadly, you can’t use the $30 credit to reduce the cost of your phone or any other Samsung device announced during Unpacked; however, you can use it for all kinds of accessories.\nAlongside the $30 credit, Samsung is offering up to $900 in credit when you trade in your phone at the time of purchase. For instance, trading in an S24 Ultra could net you up to $700 in credit. Your phone will have to meet certain eligibility requirements, though, and can’t exhibit damage beyond normal wear and tear.\nWe don’t know yet exactly what the Galaxy S26 lineup will bring, but early rumors point to a built-in privacy mode that can fully black out content from select apps or parts of the display. Reports also suggest we’ll see more Galaxy AI features — particularly new AI-powered camera tools — along with a brighter camera system.",

Luckily, Samsung’s 2025 Frame TV, which is designed to fade into the background when idle, is discounted to its lowest price to date at Woot. Now through February 28th, the 43- and 55-inch panels are on sale for $587.99 ($312 off) and $847.99 ($400 off), respectively, with additional deals available on other sizes.\nSamsung The Frame (2025)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $899.99 $587.99 at Woot (43-inch)\n $1247.99 $847.99 at Woot (55-inch)\n\nThe Frame features a slim QLED panel that can showcase more than 4,000 paintings — including works by Vincent van Gogh and more contemporary artists — via Samsung’s Art Store, helping the 4K set blend into your home decor when turned off. The digital art store lets you browse by collection, period, artist, or color, too, so you can tailor the display to suit your space. You’ll need a $50 annual subscription to access the full catalog, though Samsung does offer access to some artwork for free. \nAs we noted in our recent comparison with similar TVs from TCL and Hisense, the Frame looks the most realistic of any art-inspired TV available. That’s thanks to its anti-glare matte display, which handles reflections better than rival TVs and gives images a canvas-like texture. Plus, if you’re not into classics like Van Gogh’s Starry Night or Edvard Munch’s expressionist masterpiece, The Scream, Samsung lets you display your own photos.\nAnd, of course, when you’re ready to actually watch TV, the Frame delivers. It offers support for Dolby Atmos and HDR10 Plus for more vibrant sound and picture quality, while granting access to Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus, and all your favorite streaming apps. You also get support for both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant for hands-free voice control, along with four HDMI ports, all of which meet the gamer-friendly 2.1 spec on the larger models.
