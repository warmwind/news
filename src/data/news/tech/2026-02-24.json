    "content": "While the steepest discount is on the 43-inch model, other sizes are on sale as well.\t\n\nNot everybody wants their living room to be dominated by a big, hulking TV screen. Luckily, Samsung’s 2025 Frame TV, which is designed to fade into the background when idle, is discounted to its lowest price to date at Woot. Now through February 28th, the 43- and 55-inch panels are on sale for $587.99 ($312 off) and $847.99 ($400 off), respectively, with additional deals available on other sizes.\nSamsung The Frame (2025)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $899.99 $587.99 at Woot (43-inch)\n $1247.99 $847.99 at Woot (55-inch)\n\nThe Frame features a slim QLED panel that can showcase more than 4,000 paintings — including works by Vincent van Gogh and more contemporary artists — via Samsung’s Art Store, helping the 4K set blend into your home decor when turned off. The digital art store lets you browse by collection, period, artist, or color, too, so you can tailor the display to suit your space. You’ll need a $50 annual subscription to access the full catalog, though Samsung does offer access to some artwork for free. \nAs we noted in our recent comparison with similar TVs from TCL and Hisense, the Frame looks the most realistic of any art-inspired TV available. That’s thanks to its anti-glare matte display, which handles reflections better than rival TVs and gives images a canvas-like texture. Plus, if you’re not into classics like Van Gogh’s Starry Night or Edvard Munch’s expressionist masterpiece, The Scream, Samsung lets you display your own photos.\nAnd, of course, when you’re ready to actually watch TV, the Frame delivers. It offers support for Dolby Atmos and HDR10 Plus for more vibrant sound and picture quality, while granting access to Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus, and all your favorite streaming apps. You also get support for both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant for hands-free voice control, along with four HDMI ports, all of which meet the gamer-friendly 2.1 spec on the larger models.
