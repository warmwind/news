    "content": "GitHub Copilot Skills: Reusable AI Workflows for DevOps and SREs\n\n\nIf you're a DevOps engineer or SRE, you probably have a handful of repeatable tasks that keep coming back: triaging failed pipelines, checking for risky Terraform changes, writing runbooks, and turning messy incident notes into something your team can actually use.\nUntil recently, you could get part of the way there with custom instructions and prompt files. They are both great, but they do not fully solve the same problem: packaging a repeatable, multi-step workflow with its own supporting assets.\nThis is where Agent Skills comes in. Agent Skills is an open standard (see agentskills.io) that works with GitHub Copilot in VS Code, Copilot CLI, and the Copilot coding agent.\nIn this post we will cover what Skills are, how to set them up in VS Code, and how to use them from beginner scenarios to more advanced DevOps and SRE use cases.\nA Skill is an on-demand, reusable workflow for Copilot. A Skill lives in a folder, has a required SKILL.md, and can include supporting resources such as scripts, references, and templates.\nAt a high level, it is designed for:\nRepeatable workflows you want to reuse across a team\nMulti-step procedures that benefit from checklists and branching logic\nBundled assets such as scripts, templates, and short reference docs\nThe key idea is progressive loading:\nCopilot first uses the Skill name and description for discovery.\nIf the request matches, it loads the Skill instructions.\nIt only loads extra resources when the Skill references them.\nThis makes Skills a good fit for DevOps because you can keep the default Copilot experience lean, then load a specialised runbook only when you need it.\nSkills sit in the same overall customisation system as instructions, prompt files, custom agents, and hooks. They are not a replacement. They are a different primitive.\nHere is a practical DevOps-oriented way to think about them:\n\n\n\nPrimitive\nBest for\nDevOps example\n\n\n\n\nWorkspace instructions\nAlwa",

For example, the connected device might be nowhere near the router.\nImagine my Device A was previously connected to Wi-Fi 'XYZ' in Indonesia, but I am currently in Japan with that device. My friend in Indonesia wants to connect their Device B to that same 'XYZ' network. Since my device isn't currently within range of the signal, I can't simply generate a 'Share Wi-Fi' QR code. Need a way to view the saved password.\nProblem:\nSolve:\nsolution without entering manual script to cmd.\nPlease use this guide as intended for personal use or for helping friends or family to access networks you already have permission to use. And always be cautious when sharing Wi-Fi passwords.\nIf you run this command on Windows cmd:\nnetsh wlan show profiles\n\nThis will list all the device's connected Wi-Fi profiles 👇.\n\nTo display the password, simply add this:\nnetsh wlan show profiles name=\"<profile_name>\" key=clear | findstr Key\n\n\nNow we know how to retrieve the password, but only for single profile. Easily, we just need to loop the given list of profiles. In Python, we need to use import subprocess library.\nimport subprocess\nfrom subprocess import CalledProcessError\n\n\ndef get_all_connected_wifi_profile() -> list[str]:\n    command = f\"netsh wlan show profiles\"\n    try:\n        all_wifis = subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT).decode(\"utf-8\")\n    except UnicodeDecodeError:\n        all_wifis = subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, encoding=\"latin-1\")\n    except CalledProcessError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        print(f\"Command output: {e.output.decode('utf-8').strip()}\")\n\n    profiles = [\n        line.split(\":\")[1].strip()\n        for line in all_wifis.split(\"\\n\")\n        if \"All User Profile\" in line\n    ]\n    return profiles\n\n\ndef get_password(name:",

    "content": "Here is a scenario you will run into sooner or later building Android kiosk apps, digital signage, or any long-running background service: you need to know when the user has not interacted with the device for a certain amount of time. Maybe you want to show content after 20 seconds of idle time, then dismiss it the instant someone touches the screen again.\nYou start looking for the right API. PowerManager.isInteractive() tells you if the screen is on, not if anyone is actually using it. onUserInteraction() in an Activity only fires when your own Activity is in the foreground. There is no getLastInteractionTime() anywhere in the SDK.\nEventually you land on AccessibilityService, try it, and it works perfectly. This article walks you through exactly how, and why.\nAccessibilityService is designed for assistive technology — screen readers, switch access, voice control. That is its primary documented purpose. But what makes it useful for our use case is a side effect of how it works: the service receives accessibility events from any app on the device, system-wide, while running in the background.\nThese events include:\nTYPE_TOUCH_INTERACTION_START — user touched the screen\nTYPE_VIEW_CLICKED — user tapped a view\nTYPE_VIEW_SCROLLED — user scrolled content\nTYPE_GESTURE_DETECTION_START — a gesture was recognized\nIn other words: as long as the screen is on and the user is doing something, your service receives a steady stream of events. When that stream goes quiet, the user is idle.\nA word on Google Play policy: AccessibilityService is a privileged API. Google Play has strict rules about what justifies its use. For kiosk apps, enterprise deployments, or apps distributed outside the Play Store, this is a legitimate tool. Never use it to collect sensitive data or surveil users. If you are building a consumer app, check whether your use case actually qualifies before submitting to the store.\nAndroid Studio Hedgehog or later\nMin SDK 26+\nKotlin 1.9+\nBasic familiarity with Android S",

    "content": "One of the most important things I have learned as a software engineer is to design systems around the domain.\n“What’s the domain?” — you might ask.\nIn terms of software design, I would define the domain as any useful unit of business.\nFor example, let’s say the business is real estate. One domain might be “rentals” and another one might be “sales”. Both have their own rules and logic and represent useful units that give us a full picture of the business.\nThat’s the whole point.\nWhy would the software — the code, the database entities, the tools, etc. — use technical and obscure names? Why would the software and the business speak two different languages?\nThis disconnection creates problems we’ve all seen in software development:\nProduct/Business and engineering are talking about the same thing, but using different words. This creates unnecessary confusion and friction\nBusiness rules and semantics are all over the place. This means that the boundaries are not clear. Unclear boundaries are the perfect recipe for technical debt. This debt implies rigid software that is a headache to maintain and that doesn’t evolve with the product\nIf, instead, we design around the domain, we create expressive software. So expressive that anyone with business knowledge could understand most of what’s happening even if they don’t know the specifics of how to code.\nCode that is easy to read is one of the fundamental parts of sustainable software.\nThe domain is so important that it is the core of any kind of “clean” architecture. Every other layer relies on the domain, while the domain doesn’t rely on anything else (why would it?). This is trivial if I say that in order to understand a system, you have to start by understanding the problem it’s trying to solve.\nIt’s so important that there’s even a design philosophy called “Domain-Driven Design” (a.k.a. DDD). \nSo now, every time you hear “the domain” in this context, you know what they mean, and if you want to approach a complex system,",

No network calls, ever.\nnpm install -g expressible\n\nexpressible distill init clause-detector\ncd clause-detector\n\nAdd some labeled examples:\nexpressible distill add --file ./labeled-clauses.json\n\nThe JSON is just an array of { \"input\": \"...\", \"output\": \"...\" } objects — 50 or so pairs.\nTrain:\nexpressible distill train\n\nTraining Complete\n  Samples              87\n  Validation accuracy  93.2%\n  Time elapsed         2.8s\n\n✓ Model saved to model/\n\nRun:\nexpressible distill run \"Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time\n  for any reason by providing 90 days written notice\"\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"termination-for-convenience\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.94\n}\n\nThat ran locally. No API call. The text never left the machine.\nDistill uses all-MiniLM-L6-v2, a sentence embedding model that runs locally. It converts text into 384-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning. A small two-layer neural network trained on your labeled examples learns to map those vectors to your categories.\nThe embedding model downloads once (~80MB) and is cached. Everything after that is fully offline.\nNo Python. No GPU. No Docker. Just Node.js 18+.\nThis was important for me to document honestly.\nWorks well (80–95% accuracy): Topic and domain classificati",
