In this project, we’ll build an AI-powered CI/CD Copilot where AWS Lambda serves as the core logic layer. This Lambda function will interact with the Google Gemini API to analyze pipeline failures and help us debug them intelligently.\nThe goal of this project is not just to integrate AI into a CI/CD workflow, but to help you understand how to build your own AI agent from scratch — one that can assist in real-world DevOps scenarios.\nSo, without further ado, let’s get started.\nBefore we begin, make sure you have the following requirements in place:\nDocker & Docker Hub account\n\nWe will run parts of this project inside Docker containers. Later, we’ll push our custom image to Docker Hub, so make sure you have both Docker installed and a Docker Hub account ready.\n\n\nJenkins (Our CI/CD Tool)\n\nWe’ll use Jenkins for demonstration purposes. You can either:\n  Run Jenkins as a Docker container, or\n  Install it directly from the official website.\nTerraform\n\nWe will provision our infrastructure — including the Gemini API key (stored securely) and the AWS Lambda function — using Terraform.\nMake sure:\n  Terraform CLI is installed\n  Your AWS credentials are configured\n  The IAM user has permissions for AWS Lambda and AWS Secrets Manager\n\n\n\nIf you’re new to Terraform setup, you can follow this guide:\n\n👉 https://blog.praveshsudha.com/getting-started-with-terraform-a-beginners-guide#heading-step-1-install-the-aws-cli\nThe complete source code for this project is available in this GitHub repository:\n\n👉 https://github.com/Pravesh-Sudha/ai-devops-agent\nNavigate to the cicd-copilot directory to follow along.\nIf you’ve been following my work, you might recognize this project.

    "content": "Imagine spending years becoming a doctor. The exams, the training, the sacrifice. And then you get there and realize half your day is just... paperwork. That is what is happening to clinicians right now and it is pushing them out of the profession.\nAlmost 63% of doctors are showing signs of burnout. Nurses are leaving faster than new ones are joining. This is not a small issue we can ignore. The people responsible for keeping us healthy are exhausted and the system is not doing enough about it.\n\nHere is something most people get wrong. Doctors are not burning out because the cases are too hard. They are burning out because for every one hour they spend with a patient, they spend two hours on admin work. Notes, forms, messages, scheduling, refill approvals. It never stops.\nBy the time a doctor gets home, they are still mentally at work. They are thinking about the notes they did not finish and the calls they still have to return. That kind of pressure every single day wears a person down fast. And honestly, it should not be this way.\nLook, AI is not going to replace doctors. But it can absolutely take the boring, repetitive, time consuming tasks off their plate. Appointment reminders, patient check-ins, after hours questions, prescription refill requests, clinical note drafts. All of this can be handled automatically.\nWhen that happens, clinicians get real time back. Not just a few minutes but enough to actually breathe. Enough to sit with a patient a little longer. Enough to go home and actually switch off.\nThink about a doctor finishing their last patient at 5pm. Without AI they still have 45 minutes of note writing ahead of them. With AI the notes are already drafted and they spend 5 minutes reviewing. Done.\nA patient calls at 9pm with a basic question about their medicine. Without AI that sits in voicemail until morning and adds to an already full inbox. With AI the patient gets a clear answer right away and nobody on the team had to do a thing. Now multiply that",

    "content": "The $42 Kanban Board\n\n\n\nThis week I built a kanban board. Nothing special — Express server, React frontend, WebSocket for real-time updates. The twist? It's operated by an AI agent, and every completed task shows exactly what it cost in API tokens.\n26 tasks. $42.24 total. And the distribution is fascinating.\nClawKanban is a task board that lives inside an AI-powered workflow. An autonomous agent picks up tasks, works them, and moves them to done. Standard kanban stuff — except the agent is the developer.\nThe board itself was built this way. The agent wrote the server. The agent wrote the React UI. The agent debugged its own WebSocket issues. And now, every task card shows a purple cost badge telling you exactly what it cost to complete.\nIf you're running AI agents on real projects, you're burning API tokens constantly. Most people track this at the account level — you log into your provider dashboard, see a daily total, and shrug. That's like tracking engineering costs by looking at your total payroll without knowing who worked on what.\nPer-task costing changes how you think about AI work.\nOur cheapest task was $0.10 (adding a status LED to the UI). Our most expensive was $11.46 (building cost tracking itself — deliciously meta). But the relationship between \"how hard does this sound\" and \"what it actually costs\" is surprisingly loose.\nAdding WebSocket support? $0.29. Debugging why the UI collapsed when clicking a comment box? $1.48. The investigation cost more than the infrastructure.\nTasks involving debugging or reverse-engineering are disproportionately expensive. The real-time UI fix ($3.27) wasn't complex — add fs.watch, broadcast changes. But the agent had to read code, form hypotheses, test them, and iterate. That thinking burns tokens.\nCompare that with \"give the UI some personality\" ($1.29) — a creative task with a clear output. The agent just... did it. Dark theme, rounded cards, purple accents, done.\nTakeaway: If you want cheap AI work, give it clear spec",

    "content": "Why PageBolt MCP Burns Zero Tokens on Browser Execution\n\n\nEvery browser action a competing MCP takes costs you tokens. Not just the tool call — the DOM snapshot, the reasoning step, the retry when the selector missed, the confirmation screenshot. A single \"navigate to this URL and extract the page structure\" task can burn 2,000–5,000 tokens in a browser-use or Playwright MCP session before you get anything back.\nPageBolt MCP burns zero tokens on browser execution. One tool call. One result. Done.\nThat's not a positioning claim — it's an architectural difference.\nTools like browser-use and Playwright MCP expose browser primitives to the model: navigate, click, fill, screenshot, get_text. The model then orchestrates these into a task by calling them in sequence, reasoning between each step.\nA task like \"inspect this page and return its interactive elements\" might look like this in the model's context:\nTool call: navigate(url=\"https://example.com\")\nTool result: Page loaded\nTool call: screenshot()\nTool result: [image data, ~800 tokens]\nTool call: get_dom()\nTool result: [full DOM HTML, ~2000 tokens]\nTool call: find_elements(selector=\"button, input, a\")\nTool result: [partial list]\nTool call: screenshot() # verify state\nTool result: [image data, ~800 tokens]\n\nThat's 5 round-trips, ~4,000 tokens consumed, and the model is doing orchestration work the whole time — deciding what to call next, parsing results, handling failures. If a selector doesn't match, add another 2 round-trips.\nThis isn't a flaw in these tools. It's the design: they give the model fine-grained browser control so it can handle arbitrary tasks. The cost is proportional to complexity.\nPageBolt exposes high-level operations. The browser runs entirely on PageBolt's infrastructure. The model calls one tool, the server executes the complete operation, and the result comes back as structured data or a file.\nThe same \"inspect this page\" task:\nTool call: inspect_page(url=\"https://example.com\")\nTool result: {\n  \"el",

    "content": "Hi! I'm Iakov, UI Kit Lead at Exante. At work, we maintain a proprietary design system -- powerful, tailored to our specific needs, but closed-source. In my spare time, I rethought a number of solutions from my day job, reworked them into general-purpose patterns, and packaged them as an open-source library -- Vacano UI.\n64 components, 17 form wrappers, 1800+ icons, 10 validators, documentation for humans, and an MCP server for AI assistants.\nThere are plenty of UI libraries. Why another one?\nMost UI kits fall into two camps. Headless libraries give you logic without styles -- powerful and flexible, but you're on your own for the visuals. Opinionated libraries give you polished components out of the box, but lock you into a rigid design system that's hard to escape.\nVacano UI sits in between. Components ship with a ready-made look and work out of the box. But every sub-element is accessible for styling through typed classname slots -- no !important, no nested selectors, no digging through the DOM inspector. Want to change the trigger color on a Select? Pass classnames={{ trigger: 'my-trigger' }} and write plain CSS. TypeScript tells you which slots are available for each component.\nSecond principle -- minimal ceremony to get started. No global ThemeProvider, no createTheme, no token config that everything depends on. Install the package, import a component, render it. Providers are only required for the components that genuinely need them: Confirmation, Notification, Toastr, SaveProgress, NotifyConfirmation -- they use context and hooks because they manage global state. The other 59 components are fully autonomous.\nThird principle -- every component is finished, not half-baked. Not \"here's a <select> with some classes, good luck,\" but a complete solution with all the edge cases that surface in production. Dropdown clipped inside a modal? Portal. Date localization? Intl.DateTimeFormat, zero dependencies. OTP input on a mobile keyboard? maxLength hack. Validation erro",

They are both great, but they do not fully solve the same problem: packaging a repeatable, multi-step workflow with its own supporting assets.\nThis is where Agent Skills comes in. Agent Skills is an open standard (see agentskills.io) that works with GitHub Copilot in VS Code, Copilot CLI, and the Copilot coding agent.\nIn this post we will cover what Skills are, how to set them up in VS Code, and how to use them from beginner scenarios to more advanced DevOps and SRE use cases.\nA Skill is an on-demand, reusable workflow for Copilot. A Skill lives in a folder, has a required SKILL.md, and can include supporting resources such as scripts, references, and templates.\nAt a high level, it is designed for:\nRepeatable workflows you want to reuse across a team\nMulti-step procedures that benefit from checklists and branching logic\nBundled assets such as scripts, templates, and short reference docs\nThe key idea is progressive loading:\nCopilot first uses the Skill name and description for discovery.\nIf the request matches, it loads the Skill instructions.\nIt only loads extra resources when the Skill references them.\nThis makes Skills a good fit for DevOps because you can keep the default Copilot experience lean, then load a specialised runbook only when you need it.\nSkills sit in the same overall customisation system as instructions, prompt files, custom agents, and hooks. They are not a replacement. They are a different primitive.\nHere is a practical DevOps-oriented way to think about them:\n\n\n\nPrimitive\nBest for\nDevOps example\n\n\n\n\nWorkspace instructions\nAlwa",

    "content": "Here is a scenario you will run into sooner or later building Android kiosk apps, digital signage, or any long-running background service: you need to know when the user has not interacted with the device for a certain amount of time. Maybe you want to show content after 20 seconds of idle time, then dismiss it the instant someone touches the screen again.\nYou start looking for the right API. PowerManager.isInteractive() tells you if the screen is on, not if anyone is actually using it. onUserInteraction() in an Activity only fires when your own Activity is in the foreground. There is no getLastInteractionTime() anywhere in the SDK.\nEventually you land on AccessibilityService, try it, and it works perfectly. This article walks you through exactly how, and why.\nAccessibilityService is designed for assistive technology — screen readers, switch access, voice control. That is its primary documented purpose. But what makes it useful for our use case is a side effect of how it works: the service receives accessibility events from any app on the device, system-wide, while running in the background.\nThese events include:\nTYPE_TOUCH_INTERACTION_START — user touched the screen\nTYPE_VIEW_CLICKED — user tapped a view\nTYPE_VIEW_SCROLLED — user scrolled content\nTYPE_GESTURE_DETECTION_START — a gesture was recognized\nIn other words: as long as the screen is on and the user is doing something, your service receives a steady stream of events. When that stream goes quiet, the user is idle.\nA word on Google Play policy: AccessibilityService is a privileged API. Google Play has strict rules about what justifies its use. For kiosk apps, enterprise deployments, or apps distributed outside the Play Store, this is a legitimate tool. Never use it to collect sensitive data or surveil users. If you are building a consumer app, check whether your use case actually qualifies before submitting to the store.\nAndroid Studio Hedgehog or later\nMin SDK 26+\nKotlin 1.9+\nBasic familiarity with Android S",

One domain might be “rentals” and another one might be “sales”. Both have their own rules and logic and represent useful units that give us a full picture of the business.\nThat’s the whole point.\nWhy would the software — the code, the database entities, the tools, etc. — use technical and obscure names? Why would the software and the business speak two different languages?\nThis disconnection creates problems we’ve all seen in software development:\nProduct/Business and engineering are talking about the same thing, but using different words. This creates unnecessary confusion and friction\nBusiness rules and semantics are all over the place. This means that the boundaries are not clear. Unclear boundaries are the perfect recipe for technical debt. This debt implies rigid software that is a headache to maintain and that doesn’t evolve with the product\nIf, instead, we design around the domain, we create expressive software. So expressive that anyone with business knowledge could understand most of what’s happening even if they don’t know the specifics of how to code.\nCode that is easy to read is one of the fundamental parts of sustainable software.\nThe domain is so important that it is the core of any kind of “clean” architecture. Every other layer relies on the domain, while the domain doesn’t rely on anything else (why would it?). This is trivial if I say that in order to understand a system, you have to start by understanding the problem it’s trying to solve.\nIt’s so important that there’s even a design philosophy called “Domain-Driven Design” (a.k.a. DDD). \nSo now, every time you hear “the domain” in this context, you know what they mean, and if you want to approach a complex system,",

    "content": "IBM z/OS mainframes process ~87% of global credit card transactions. The password hashing system protecting those systems — RACF Legacy DES — has 42.17 bits of effective entropy instead of 56. That's crackable in 7.6 minutes on a consumer GPU. Cost: $0.08.\nI validated this bit-for-bit on a real IBM z15 running z/OS V2.5. 4/4 perfect match between my model and the production implementation.\nAll findings obtained with a standard student account. No exploits. No privilege escalation. Just a statistical framework (CASI — IEEE peer-reviewed, ICECET 2026) and reading what the system showed me.\nThe fix for every finding already exists in z/OS. KDFAES has been available since 2007. AT-TLS, MQ SSL, ICSF authorization — all single configuration changes. The gap is not capability. It is configuration.\nFull technical report (15 pages, 50 findings): https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18755826\nResponsible disclosure to IBM PSIRT initiated.",

    "content": "The first time I check the Wallet Service dashboard in production, CloudWatch shows 11,400 requests per minute.\nI close the laptop. I open it again. The number hasn't changed. Eleven thousand four hundred gem transactions every sixty seconds, flowing through the service I designed, the one I wrote the first commit for, the one I never imagined would breathe at this rate.\nIt's 8 PM. My apartment is quiet. The dashboard isn't.\nI need to tell you where I was before this. Because the gap matters.\nBefore I built this, I was working on a mobile app with maybe 200,000 users. A respectable number. The kind of number where a production bug means you get a Slack thread with four messages and someone says \"I'll look at it after lunch.\" The kind of number where your on-call rotation is a polite fiction. Nobody actually gets woken up.\nThen I got the contract to build the social platform. Not join. Build. The whole ecosystem. Social media, advertising, food delivery, live streaming, gaming, e-commerce. What would eventually become ninety-five repositories. What would eventually reach thirty million monthly active users.\nBut when I wrote the first line of code, 30M was a fantasy. I was thinking about hundreds of users. Then thousands. The architecture decisions I made early on, the ones baked into the foundation, were made by a version of me who had never operated at scale. And now those decisions run a small economy.\nThat's the part nobody warns you about. You don't get to go back and ask the person who made the critical design choices if they really thought it through. Because that person was you, two years ago, with less context than you have now.\nI'm tracing the virtual currency advertising flow. One I designed. A merchant creates a campaign, let's say 50,000 GEMs to boost a restaurant post. Those GEMs go into escrow in the Wallet Service. Users scroll their feed, see the boosted post, engage with it. Each engagement triggers a flow: the Ad Engine processes the engagement, cal",

Different input. Over and over.\nTwo problems kept coming up:\nData sensitivity. For teams handling contracts, patient records, or internal logs, sending that data to a third-party API isn't always an option.\nCost. At scale, you're paying per-token for what is essentially structured pattern matching.\nSo I built an open-source CLI that trains a small local text classifier from labeled examples. You give it ~50 input/output pairs, it trains a ~230KB model on your machine, and you run inference locally. No network calls, ever.\nnpm install -g expressible\n\nexpressible distill init clause-detector\ncd clause-detector\n\nAdd some labeled examples:\nexpressible distill add --file ./labeled-clauses.json\n\nThe JSON is just an array of { \"input\": \"...\", \"output\": \"...\" } objects — 50 or so pairs.\nTrain:\nexpressible distill train\n\nTraining Complete\n  Samples              87\n  Validation accuracy  93.2%\n  Time elapsed         2.8s\n\n✓ Model saved to model/\n\nRun:\nexpressible distill run \"Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time\n  for any reason by providing 90 days written notice\"\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"termination-for-convenience\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.94\n}\n\nThat ran locally. No API call. The text never left the machine.\nDistill uses all-MiniLM-L6-v2, a sentence embedding model that runs locally. It converts text into 384-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning. A small two-layer neural network trained on your labeled examples learns to map those vectors to your categories.\nThe embedding model downloads once (~80MB) and is cached. Everything after that is fully offline.\nNo Python. No GPU. No Docker. Just Node.js 18+.\nThis was important for me to document honestly.\nWorks well (80–95% accuracy): Topic and domain classificati",
